            <p style="text-align: justify;">This project is an e-commerce landing page developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to create a dynamic and user-friendly online shopping experience. I designed the front-end with HTML and CSS to ensure a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. JavaScript was utilized to add interactive features, such as a product carousel for showcasing featured items and form validation to ensure accurate user inputs during checkout or inquiries.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">On the back-end, I implemented PHP to handle form submissions, such as processing customer inquiries or newsletter sign-ups, and to manage dynamic content like product listings retrieved from a database. This project allowed me to integrate front-end and back-end technologies effectively, enhancing my skills in creating functional and visually appealing web applications tailored for e-commerce purposes. It also taught me the importance of optimizing performance and ensuring security in handling user data.</p>
